Hi!
I'm a CS student from Spain and I'm rather new to GitHub. 

In this repository I'll try to add all the code I wrrite in Java while in uni, just to keep track of things and have everything stored in one place.

As of right now this mainly consists on the code I'm writing in my Data Structures class, if I upload something I made outside of this class it will be properly indicated.

Thanks for checking this out!!
